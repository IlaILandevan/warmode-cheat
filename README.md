A cheat for the shitty game [WARMODE](https://store.steampowered.com/app/391460/WARMODE/) by stikosek.
Was started in a channalnge with JNNJ and terrain to make a cheat in 24 hours.

# Features
 - No recoil
 - No ammo usage
 - Teleport to team spawn
 - ESP (Higlights teamates green and enemies red)
 - Rapid fire (Fun as fuck lmao)
 - AimBot (Work in progress but still useful now)
 - Infinite stamina (Not really but kinda works)

I really do reccomend you use No ammo usage + rapid fire its op as fuck
